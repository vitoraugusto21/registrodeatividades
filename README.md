<h1>⏺️Activity-Record⏺️<h1>

>Status: Ready ✔️

### This is a project that was created by my college where I simulate an application to record the activities of a graduation fair and store them in a data structure.

The application options are:

+ Register Activity - Record the activities and save to a data structure
+ Show Activity - Show activities already registered
+ Show Report - Show a report of the activities indicating how many activities will take place on each of the days and how many activities of each type are scheduled
+ Save - create a text file 'programacao.txt' (if it already exists, overwrite it) containing the schedule of the Graduation Fair, with the activities divided by weekday and time
+ Exit - Before interrupting the program execution, it stores the data of all activities in a file.

When starting the program, before displaying the menu, if there is a file with stored data, the data should be read into the same data structure as in item 2
